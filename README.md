# Collaborative Filtering Recommender System

This project has implemented model-based CF (both user-user and item-item) and memory-based CF to predict ratings. The model-based CF makes use of SVD and the memory-based CF uses cosine similarity to learn which users and items are similar to eachother. 

The dataset used in this project is the 100kmovielens dataset which can be downloaded from [here](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip).
